# What is CURXCH?
CURXCH allows you to convert the world's major currencies with the most updated exchange rates published by the European Central Bank. Listing multiple currencies in one screen is really simple and easy with CURXCH.  

## How to use CURXCH?
- You only need to do is adding new currency into to main (converter) screen. You can add as many currencies as you want! Tap the "SELL" currency value to change it. Change value by typing the keyboard, all currency values will be changed automatically on each type. Any feedback about the experience? I would love to hear from you!

## Where did the idea come from?
- The idea of converting currencies is not so different and unique as you know. Obviously, I hadn't thought too much on it. I have been already using a currency converter app, it is unnecessarily complex to use it. So I decided to make a new one with a goal: keep it simple and add some fancy features on it!
- The main reason behind developing a hobby project is:
	1. Learning new things,
	2. Applying things that you've learned,
	3. Demonstrating my coding style and getting feedback from people,
	4. Practicing all-the-time so I can keep things that I learned fresh,
	5. Improving skills, acquiring new ones.

-For getting all of the things above to happen, I decided to make everything open-source and I loved that idea!

##  Tech stack
- You can look at the code if you are interested but I want to summarize the tech stack that I prefer in short:
	1. Swift 4.2
	2. MVVM  -  architectural design pattern
	3. Clean architecture  -  using an app router and container, builders, contracts
	4. CoreData  -  to store currencies
	5. XCTests  -  with low test coverage
	6. Bitrise  -  CI&CD tool (If you interested in using Bitrise, this article that I wrote about a month ago might be helpful for you)
